For my React Notes app, I implemented different components including a note component and a create_note component to instantiate a new note through an input bar. These components are rendered in my index file, which uses Immutable to iterate through a map of notes to display them. What did work was the utilization of different open source frameworks to add features to my notes, including dragging, markdown and an expandable textarea.
